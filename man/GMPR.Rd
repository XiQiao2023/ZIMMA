\title{Geometric Mean of Pairwise Ratios (GMPR) Normalization}
\usage{
GMPR(comm, intersect.no = 1, ct.min = 1, trace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A matrix or data frame of raw count data (features x samples), where rows are taxa/features and columns are samples.}

\item{intersect.no}{Integer. Minimum number of shared features required for calculating pairwise ratios (default = 1).}

\item{ct.min}{Integer. Minimum count threshold to consider a feature as present (default = 1).}

\item{trace}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages during computation (default = TRUE).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of sample-specific size factors, with names corresponding to the sample IDs.
}
\description{
This function calculates normalizing factors for microbiome sequencing data (or more generally, zero-inflated sequencing data)
using the GMPR method. The resulting size factors can be used as offsets in count-based regression models or to produce normalized data.
