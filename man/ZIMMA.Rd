\title{ZIMMA: Zero-Inflated Microbiome Mediation Analysis}
\usage{
ZIMMA(
  object = physeq,
  Outcome = Outcome,
  Treat = Treat,
  C.med = NULL,
  C.out = NULL,
  M.level = M.level,
  n_iter = 100,
  burn_in = 20,
  Size = "RLEpseudo",
  pseudo = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A phyloseq object containing microbiome count data and associated metadata.}

\item{Outcome}{Character. The name of the outcome variable in the sample metadata.}

\item{Treat}{Character. The name of the treatment/exposure variable in the sample metadata.}

\item{C.med}{Optional. A vector of covariate names used as confounders in the mediator model.}

\item{C.out}{Optional. A vector of covariate names used as confounders in the outcome model.}

\item{M.level}{Character. Taxonomic level to use (e.g., "Genus", "Family").}

\item{n_iter}{Integer. Total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{burn_in}{Integer. Number of burn-in iterations to discard.}

\item{Size}{Character. Library size estimation method (e.g., "GMPR", "TSS", "RLEpseudo").}

\item{pseudo}{Numeric. Pseudo-count added during library size estimation to avoid division by zero.}
}
\value{
A list containing parameter posterior samples, and the phyloseq object.
}
\description{
This function performs Bayesian dual mediation analysis for microbiome data, accounting for zero inflation in taxa counts.
It models both prevalence and abundance components of each microbial feature to identify mediators of treatment effects on outcomes.
